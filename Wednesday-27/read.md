I have fixes the changes told by kamal sir

-> date.now() fixed to limited 3 random numbers
-> if email already exists, console Email already exists before entring the role.
-> if we enter random laptop name, console laptop not found.
-> if laptop array is empty, and we try to perform search and delete, console can't perform the operations.

->worked on Employee Panel
1. Welcome Employee
1. About Me = consoled the Employee details with Name, email, username, role and borrowed laptop
2. View All Laptops = we can view all laptops present in the stock 
// 3. Search Laptop by Name =we can search laptops present in stock
// 4. Take One = employee can take 1 laptop from laptop array, we have to add that laptop in user details and reduced the counting of laptopb by 1 in laptop array.
