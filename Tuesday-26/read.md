// today I created a user Registeration system in which we have 4 options:

1. Login user as CW Admin
2. Login as Employee
3. Register yourself 
4. Exit

In 1st and 2nd option, we have to console In Progress....

in 3rd option register yourself, we have to take name, email and role from the user and then generate a username, after that add user to the users array and console User Register Successfully.

In last option simply exists 

I have used switch cases, array objects and if else to execute theh task 

In 3rd option, taken name, email and role form user via prompt then if the data is proper, I have generated using username
then created an object of user data added it to the users array and console Registeration succeassful. 

lastly exits.
